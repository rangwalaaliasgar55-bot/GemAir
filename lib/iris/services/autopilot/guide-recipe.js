// step is routinely left in the macOS branch's POSIX form —
//
//   cd ~
//   if [ ! -d App/.git ]; then
//   git clone https://…/App.git
//   fi
//
// — which is a hard PowerShell ParserError (`[ … ]`, `then`, `fi` are all
// invalid syntax, not missing commands), so NOTHING in the step runs, not even
// the `git clone`, and the deterministic "command not found" self-heal never
// fires (a ParserError matches none of its signatures). That strands the reader
// at the very step that copies the source onto the machine, across most of the
// source-build catalog. Rather than trust every guide author to hand-translate
// this one construct, the derivation rewrites it to PowerShell for the Windows
// command and keeps the ORIGINAL as the `posixCommand`, so Iris-on-a-Mac (the
// test host) still drives the shape zsh understands. A command with no POSIX test
// construct is left untouched, so the many already-cross-platform steps — and a
// guide later fixed to native PowerShell — pay nothing and are never corrupted.
/// Whether a command carries a POSIX shell construct PowerShell cannot parse (a
/// `[ -x … ]` file test, or a line that is a bare `then`/`fi`), so the Windows
