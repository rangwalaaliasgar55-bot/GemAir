// Turns a raw shell command into one plain-English line for the reader watching
// an install run in the autopilot terminal. The audience is non-technical:
// "Getting the app's code…" reads, `git clone https://github.com/…` does not.
// The real command still shows underneath, de-emphasised, so the terminal still
// reads as technical work — but the friendly line is what carries the meaning.
//
// The Windows/TS port of macOS `GuideAutopilotFriendlyLabel.swift`, widened for
// the Windows package managers (winget/choco/scoop) and PowerShell shapes. A
// heuristic with an honest catch-all: it never claims a different action than the
// command performs; the worst case is the generic "Running a setup step…", never
// a wrong specific one. Pure, so `runner.ts` can call it and vitest can pin it.
