// The "your turn" tray state, as a pure reducer over autopilot events.
//
// The tray (src/main/tray.ts) can't be reached by the vitest suite — it imports
// Electron — so the DECISION of when the tray should say "your turn", and when
// to fire a one-off toast, lives here where it can be unit-tested, exactly the
// `main`/`services` split the rest of the app uses. `tray.ts` is a thin adaptor
// that feeds events in and applies the update to Electron.
//
// A run is "waiting on the reader" whenever it stops on something only a person
// can settle: a sign-in / permission / manual step (`handedToReader`), a command
// that needs one confirm tap (`needsConfirm`), or a failure it surfaced
// (`surfaced`). It is "moving again" the moment the next step starts, a command
// runs, or the run ends. The toast fires only on the TRANSITION into waiting, so
// a burst of events while already waiting does not re-notify.
//
