// The autopilot state machine — the Windows port of the macOS drive loop in
// `GuideSessionController.driveAutopilotFromTheCurrentStep`.
//
// It is a *pumped* machine, not a background task: the main process calls
// `runUntilBlocked`, drains the events it produced, and forwards them to the
// renderer; when the machine stops on something only the reader can settle (a
// sign-in, a confirm tap) the caller resumes it with `readerFinishedCurrentStep`
// or `confirmCurrentCommand`. Keeping timers and windows out of the core is what
// lets the whole thing be unit-tested with a `MockShell` on any host.
//
// The no-click rule matches macOS: a `command` step runs and advances itself; an
// `open` step is finished the moment GemAir opens it, so it advances with no tap;
// only `sign_in`/`permission`/`manual` steps stop and wait for the reader, with
// an instruction the UI floats the eye next to.
