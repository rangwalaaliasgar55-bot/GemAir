// The failure-fix ladder — the Windows port of the macOS self-repair loop that
// lives across `GuideAutopilotRunner.runFailureLadder` / `climbTheFixLadder`,
// `GuideAutopilotFixProposer`, `GuideAutopilotCodexFixProposer`, and
// `GuideAutopilotCommandShape`.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR. On macOS, when a guide command fails the runner does not hand
// the reader a dead terminal: it asks the model for ONE structured fix, runs it
// under the same safety gate, retries the original, and only surfaces to the
// reader once it has run out of rungs, budget, or ideas. This module is that
// loop, reimplemented Windows-idiomatically:
//
//   - The transport is `MaintainModelProviding.respond()` (the same BYO
//     Anthropic/OpenAI seam maintain mode already uses — never a publik host,
//     never a funded proxy), driven with the *Codex* plain-text contract: the
//     model is asked for ONE fenced json block and nothing else, which is parsed
//     leniently and handed to the ONE validator both macOS routes share. There
//     is no tool-use wire format to force over a `respond()` call, exactly as
//     there is none over `codex exec`, so the fenced-block trick is the port.
//
//   - The gate is `risk.ts`, at `model_proposed_fix` provenance — the stricter
//     one, where opacity (`$()`, backticks, `eval`) trips the tap even for a
//     command that would otherwise run. A model's repair is untrusted text, and
//     this is the compensating control that keeps it honest.
//
//   - The host allowlist is the structural answer to a hallucinated hostname: a
//     proposed `run_a_command` may only reach hosts the recipe's OWN commands
//     and links already name. A plausible-sounding new domain is refused no
//     matter how plausible it sounds. Ported from
//     `GuideAutopilotCommandShape.hostsTheCommandWouldReach` +
//     `GuideAutopilotFixProposer.validatedFix`.
//
// It is a pure module (no Node/Electron/Windows APIs, no secret at rest): the
// model provider, the shell, the environment strings, and the confirm callback
// are all injected, so the whole ladder runs in the vitest suite with a scripted
// fake provider and a `MockShell` on any host. The runner (`runner.ts`) calls
// `FixLadder.repair` from its one `failed`-command branch; everything else here
// is reachable and asserted directly.
