// The gate every command passes before the autopilot shell will run it.
//
// TRUST BOUNDARY — read this. The rest of iris-windows holds a hard invariant
// (see tool-versions.ts): "no part of a command is ever built from guide text;
// there is no escape hatch." The autopilot deliberately relaxes that invariant —
// it runs commands that come from a recipe — so this module is the compensating
// control, and the relaxation is bounded three ways:
//
//   1. Provenance is the real boundary. Recipe commands come only from reviewed,
//      version-pinned recipe modules in this repo (shipped, not fetched as text
//      from an arbitrary guide). Model-proposed fix commands (a later increment)
//      are marked `model_proposed_fix` and gated harder.
//   2. This gate refuses outright the handful of commands no tap can make
//      informed (piping a download into a shell, wiping a disk), waves through
//      the ordinary, and pauses the rest for one explicit reader tap.
//   3. `ApprovedCommand` is the only value the shell will run, and it is minted
//      only by the two functions here — "run an unassessed command" cannot be
//      expressed elsewhere in the code.
//
// It is a guardrail against mistakes, not a defence against an adversary; regexes
// over command text are defeatable by construction, which is exactly why opacity
// itself trips the gate for untrusted (model) commands. Ported from the macOS
// `GuideAutopilotRiskAssessment.swift`, adapted for PowerShell/winget.
