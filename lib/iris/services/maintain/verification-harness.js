//
// The gate between "a patch applied" and "a fix is real". GemAir is both
// prosecutor and defendant here — it authors the test AND the fix — and the
// agentic-coding literature is unambiguous about how that ends without hard
// checks: patches that pass their own test while breaking six others, tests
// quietly rewritten to match the patch, "fixes" that are the answer key
// retrieved rather than derived.
//
// So the harness runs legs, and every leg is a hard block:
//
//   leg 1   the repro fails BEFORE the patch        (proves the test sees the bug)
//   leg 2   the repro passes AFTER the patch         (proves the patch does something)
//   leg 3   revert the patch, repro fails again      (proves the test wasn't tautological)
//           — then re-apply. One extra build; the only defense there is
//           against a self-verifying agent when nobody else wrote an oracle.
//   build   the app still builds at all
//   suite   the app's own full test suite stays green (PASS_TO_PASS)
//
// A replayed recipe arrives with no repro test — its evidence came from other
// machines — so legs 1-3 are skipped and it earns only `applied` + build +
// suite, never a `verified` outcome without the full gate. `earnsVerifiedFix`
// and `earnsCleanApply` keep those two standards separate on purpose.
//
// Ported verbatim from `VerificationHarness.swift`, including the diff-scope
// gate running FIRST, before a single build or test — a fix that passes the
// suite can still be wrong in ways the suite cannot see: it deletes the
// failing test to go green, or it sprawls across the codebase. The suite is
// necessary, not sufficient; the diff-scope gate is the other half, and a
// block there is as hard as a failed leg.
