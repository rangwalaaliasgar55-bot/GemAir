// traces — verification blocked, a patch queued, a replay superseded or
// conflicted — so the Windows build is diagnosable the same way the Mac build
// already is. This is parity of *observability*, not just of behavior: a
// support engineer reading Windows logs should recognize the same shape of
// narrative a Mac log tells.
//
// Deliberately not a logging library — one function, one prefix, `console.log`.
// If maintain mode ever needs structured logs or log levels, that is a
// different module; this one stays exactly as small as the thing it ports.
