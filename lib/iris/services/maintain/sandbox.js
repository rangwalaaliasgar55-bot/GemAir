/**
 * sandbox.ts
 *
 * The Windows port of `iris-macos/leanring-buddy/MaintainSandbox.swift`.
 *
 * The jail Tier C's exploration and edits run inside. Novel-fix commands come
 * from a model reasoning over the user's own repo — weaker provenance than a
 * version-pinned guide command — so `autopilot/risk.ts`'s gate is not enough
 * on its own (and is not even in the loop here, per the ground rules: Tier C
 * commands never pass through it). The sandbox is the compensating boundary.
 *
 * Swift's original is built on `sandbox-exec` (Seatbelt): a kernel-enforced
 * mandatory-access-control profile that denies all network and allows writes
 * only under the repo root and the system temp dir, no install required. There
 * is no Seatbelt on Windows, and no equivalent kernel MAC hook reachable
 * without a native module (out of scope per this app's "no native module"
 * convention — see `iris-windows/CLAUDE.md` and `main/powershell-session.ts`).
 * The ratified composition instead is:
 *
 *   1. A WINDOWS JOB OBJECT, with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` plus an
 *      active-process-count ceiling and a job-wide memory ceiling. Every
 *      process the jailed command spawns (build tools regularly fork
 *      children) is captured by the job; the moment the job's handle closes,
 *      every process still in it is killed. No orphaned children survive a
 *      killed or timed-out jailed command — this is the real, kernel-enforced
 *      half of the containment, and it is Seatbelt-equivalent in strength for
 *      "nothing outlives this run" even though it polices a different axis
 *      (process lifetime, not filesystem access).
 *   2. A RESTRICTED TOKEN (`CreateRestrictedToken` with `DISABLE_MAX_PRIVILEGE`)
 *      derived from GemAir's OWN process token and handed to the child via
 *      `CreateProcessAsUser`. This is the one piece that could have needed
 *      elevation and does not: `CreateProcessAsUser` only requires the
 *      `SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME`/`SE_INCREASE_QUOTA_NAME` privileges when
 *      the token being assigned belongs to a DIFFERENT principal than the
 *      caller. Since Windows XP SP2, the API special-cases the token being a
 *      RESTRICTED VERSION OF THE CALLER'S OWN TOKEN and waives that
 *      requirement — which is exactly this shape (self-token in, restricted
 *      self-token out). That is what makes "drop privileges for a child, from
 *      an ordinary non-elevated desktop app" possible here at all.
 *   3. NETWORK BLOCKED, best-effort, two layers: (a) `HTTP_PROXY`/
 *      `HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` set to a black hole (`http://127.0.0.1:1`) so
 *      any HTTP client that honors proxy env vars gets nothing, and (b) a
 *      Windows Firewall outbound-block rule scoped to a UNIQUE PER-INVOCATION
 *      COPY of `powershell.exe` (never the system original — Windows Firewall
 *      rules key on program path, not PID, and there is no PID-scoped rule
 *      primitive; a fresh, uniquely-named copy of the binary is the closest
 *      the platform gets to "keyed to the child image" without touching every
 *      other `powershell.exe` process on the machine, including GemAir's own).
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * CONTAINMENT MATRIX — read this before trusting or "fixing" anything here.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVIDES, roughly matching Seatbelt:
 *   - No orphaned processes survive a killed/timed-out command (Job Object).
 *   - A resource ceiling on process count and memory that Seatbelt does not
 *     even attempt (extra, not present in the macOS jail).
 *   - A privilege-stripped child token (fewer enabled privileges, a smaller
 *     set of presentable group SIDs) — narrows what the process could do if
 *     it tried something malicious with an API that checks privileges.
 *   - A best-effort network block via two independent mechanisms.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVIDE, unlike Seatbelt — the load-bearing gaps:
 *   - NO MANDATORY WRITE CONFINEMENT. Seatbelt's `(allow file-write*
 *     (subpath root) (subpath tempDir))` is KERNEL-ENFORCED: nothing outside
 *     those two paths can be written, full stop, no matter what the
 *     sandboxed process tries. Windows has no reachable analog here without a
 *     native module (a low-integrity-level token plus an AppContainer plus
 *     custom DACLs would get close; explicitly out of scope per this app's
 *     "no native module" rule). `repoRootPath` below is a CONVENTION — the
 *     child's working directory is set there, and the caller
 *     (`tier-c-fixer.ts`) only ever asks the model to make in-repo edits —
 *     never an OS-enforced boundary. A restricted token still runs as the
 *     SAME logged-in user and can read/write anything an ordinary
 *     unprivileged process belonging to that user can. THIS IS THE SINGLE
 *     BIGGEST GAP versus Seatbelt; do not describe this jail as filesystem
 *     containment anywhere in the app.
 *   - The network block is BEST-EFFORT, not kernel-enforced. A raw socket
 *     that ignores proxy env vars is untouched by the proxy layer. The
 *     firewall rule is real (Windows Firewall does enforce outbound rules at
 *     the kernel filter-driver level for the exact program path it names),
 *     but it is still just one rule among many on the box — a sufficiently
 *     privileged process could add a competing allow rule, and the rule
 *     protects only the unique copy of `powershell.exe` this invocation
 *     creates, not arbitrary other binaries the jailed command might invoke
 *     directly (a command that shells out to `curl.exe` or `git.exe` for
 *     network access, for instance, is not covered by this rule at all — the
 *     proxy-env-var layer is the only thing that might catch that, and only
 *     if that tool honors proxy env vars). This is defense-in-depth alongside
 *     the job/token containment, never a hard guarantee — exactly what
 *     "best-effort, ships everywhere" was ratified to mean.
 *   - No `sysctl-read`/`mach-lookup`-style fine-grained denial. Windows draws
 *     no equivalent line; a restricted-token process can still query most
 *     local system information an ordinary user process could.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * WHY THIS FILE STAYS "PURE" DESPITE DESCRIBING REAL WIN32 MACHINERY
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * `services/` in this app never imports `electron` or `child_process` (see
 * `github-fork-service.ts`'s footer and `main/powershell-session.ts`'s
 * header) — the real process-spawning implementation always lives in
 * `main/`. This file honors that by never spawning anything itself: every
 * function below either builds plain strings (the PowerShell + inline C#
 * script that WILL, when run, do everything described above) or takes an
 * already-injected `MaintainShellRunner` (the same seam every other
 * `services/maintain/` file uses) to execute a short cleanup command through.
 * `WindowsJobObjectSandbox.jailedInvocation` therefore returns an
 * `invocation` string that the CALLER runs via its own `MaintainShellRunner`
 * — exactly the shape Swift's `MaintainSandbox.jailedInvocation` returns
 * (`(invocation: String, profilePath: String)`), and exactly how
 * `tier-c-fixer.ts` already runs every other command in this app. Nothing in
 * this file needs Windows to be tested: `buildSandboxIdentifiers` and
 * `buildJailedPowerShellScript` are plain string-builders, asserted on by
 * substring in `tests/maintain-sandbox.test.ts` the same way
 * `verification-harness.test.ts` asserts on `verifyAppliedPatch`'s exact git
 * ceremony.
