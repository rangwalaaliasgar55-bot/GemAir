/**
 * autopilot-entry.js
 *
 * Adds the "Let GemAir run it" entry point the guide panel does not have.
 * `app.js`'s own header says so directly: "This panel is not the autopilot:
 * nobody's shell is being driven... this panel never reaches the autopilot
 * runner (there is no takeover from here)." That is deliberate — app.js is a
 * byte-for-byte transplant of `gemair-desktop/ui/app.js` and CLAUDE.md forbids
 * rewriting it to add Windows-only behaviour, the same reason gemair-bridge.js
 * exists as a separate file rather than a fork of app.js.
 *
 * So this reads app.js from the OUTSIDE instead, through the one surface it
 * already exposes for exactly that purpose: the frozen `window.__IRIS__`
 * object (`getState()`). There is no event for "a guide finished loading" to
 * hook into — app.js re-renders by toggling `hidden` on whichever of
 * `#loading-state`/`#guide-state`/`#error-state`/`#review-state`/
 * `#complete-state` is current — so a `MutationObserver` on exactly those
 * five elements' own `hidden` attribute (NOT their subtree) reacts the moment
 * app.js does, instead of a poll that would either lag behind a real state
 * change or hammer `autopilot_can_install` on a tight timer. `subtree: true`
 * on a shared ancestor was the first attempt, and it is a trap: this
 * button lives inside `#guide-state`, so `refresh()` setting `button.hidden`
 * would itself be an observed mutation, re-triggering `refresh()`
 * synchronously forever — a self-feeding microtask loop that pegs the CPU
 * and never yields, since it never reaches a real timer or I/O. Observing
 * the five section elements directly (no subtree) watches exactly the
 * signal that matters and excludes the button by construction. A slow
 * interval stays underneath as a backstop only, in case some future render
 * path changes state without touching one of these five elements.
 *
 * Mirrors gemair-macos's guide-bar button (`OverlayEyeInputBar.swift`,
 * `Button("Let GemAir run it", action: { guideSessionController.startAutopilot() })`):
 * offered whenever the current guide's Windows branch has a derivable
 * autopilot recipe (`autopilot_can_install`), wired to opening the autopilot
 * window for that same slug (`autopilot_open`) — both already handled by
 * `handleGuideCommand` in `main/index.ts`; nothing in this app's IPC surface
 * needed to change for the button to reach them.
